# Day 3 / May 6 (Fri)

Today, we focus on the following:

1. Developing dockerized Spark and Kafka Streams application
1. Contributing to a git repo on Github (using pull requests and issues)

## In the Morning

Reviewing [pull requests](https://github.com/jaceklaskowski/scala-academy-sandbox/pulls) to `scala-academy-sandbox` repo.

## Exercise 1: File Listing

Create a dockerized Scala command-line application that accepts a directory to list files from.

```console
docker run [imageName] /path/to/a/directory
```

Push the code to a Github repo.

## Exercise 2: Docker Mount

It's a follow-up exercise to [Exercise 1](#exercise-1).

Read [Manage application data](https://docs.docker.com/storage/) and mount a directory outside the Docker image to list files from.

## Exercise 3: Dockerized Spark App

1. Create a dockerized Spark application that loads files from one or more directories
    1. Use `local[*]` master URL
    1. Use scopt to handle command line (or stick to `args`)

# Day 3 / May 6 (Fri)

Today, the team puts focus on the following:

1. Developing dockerized Spark and Kafka Streams application
1. Contributing to a git repo on Github (using pull requests and issues)

## In the Morning

Reviewing [pull requests](https://github.com/jaceklaskowski/scala-academy-sandbox/pulls) to `scala-academy-sandbox` repo.

## Exercise: File Listing

Create a dockerized Scala command-line application that accepts a directory to list files from.

```console
docker run [imageName] /path/to/a/directory
```

Push the code to a Github repo.

### Removing Images by ID

Read [Format command and log output](https://docs.docker.com/config/formatting/).

   -->

```text
docker rmi -f $(docker images --format '{{ "{{.ID}}" }}' 'mateusz/*')
```

## Exercise: Docker Mount

It's a follow-up exercise to [Exercise 1](#exercise-1).

Read [Manage application data](https://docs.docker.com/storage/) and mount a directory outside the Docker image to list files from.

## Exercise: Dockerized Spark App

Create a dockerized Spark application that loads files from one or more directories.

1. Use `local[*]` master URL
1. Use [scopt](https://github.com/scopt/scopt) to handle command line (or use `args`)

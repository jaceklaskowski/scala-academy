# Day 2 / May 5 (Thu)

Focusing on Docker and developing dockerized Scala apps

## Opening

A new month, new challenges.

1. Switching gears and putting closer look at project collaboration using `git`, Github and pull requests
    1. PRs to the main [scala-academy-sandbox](https://github.com/jaceklaskowski/scala-academy-sandbox) repo
    1. Whatever needs to be reviewed should be a PR
    1. Use packages with your first name to scope your own classes
1. Thu till the lunch break (12pm) in the office. At home later on.
    1. Checkpoints at 1:30pm and 2:15pm
1. Working remotely
    1. Fri this week
    1. Mon and Tue next week
    1. _perhaps even the whole week_

## In the Morning

1. A demo of a dockerized Scala app (from the [exercise](./001.md#exercise) yesterday) by the one and only Adam
1. Exploring [sbt-docker](https://github.com/marcuslonnberg/sbt-docker) together

## Exercise

1. Create a Docker image of a Scala command-line application that uses [scopt](https://github.com/scopt/scopt) (as an external dependency)
    1. `--help` for a demo is enough. _Thanks Ania!_
1. Use [sbt-docker](https://github.com/marcuslonnberg/sbt-docker) plugin to create a Docker image
1. Run the Scala application as a Docker container

## In the Late Afternoon

1. A demo of a dockerized Scala app by Mateusz
1. Contributing to [scala-academy-sandbox](https://github.com/jaceklaskowski/scala-academy-sandbox/) using [pull requests](https://github.com/jaceklaskowski/scala-academy-sandbox/pulls)

# Day 5 / Apr 25 (Mon)

## Welcome to Week 9

Coming up are 3 days to develop a solid foundation of [Kafka Streams](https://kafka.apache.org/31/documentation/streams/) with Scala.

One day for [Kafka Connect](008.md) and another for [Akka Streams](009.md). Just a tiny bit as they are considered information-only.

## Morning Exercises

### Algorithmic Thinking

1. [[2020-10-21] Challenge #386 [Intermediate] Partition counts](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/jfcuz5/20201021_challenge_386_intermediate_partition/)

### Object-Oriented Programming

Define a `Room` class that should do the following:

1. A room has a name and capacity
    * capacity = the maximum number of people that can enter a room
1. A person can enter a room (only when there is still free space)
1. A person can leave a room
1. A room can report the number of people inside (who entered)

Write tests and publish to Github.

## Theory

1. Read [Introducing Kafka Streams: Stream Processing Made Simple](https://www.confluent.io/blog/introducing-kafka-streams-stream-processing-made-simple/)
1. Read [Writing A Streams Application](https://kafka.apache.org/31/documentation/streams/developer-guide/write-streams.html)
1. Read [Kafka Streams DSL for Scala](https://kafka.apache.org/31/documentation/streams/developer-guide/dsl-api.html#scala-dsl)

## Demo

1. [Run Kafka Streams Demo Application](https://kafka.apache.org/31/documentation/streams/quickstart)

## Practice

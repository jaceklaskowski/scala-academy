## Morning Exercise

### Word Count Per Record

Remember [Exercise: Word Count Per Record](https://jaceklaskowski.github.io/kafka-workshop/exercises/kafka-exercise-Word-Count-Per-Record.html)? Use Kafka Streams this time.

### Object-Oriented Programming

Define the following classes to represent 2-dimentional figures:

1. `Triangle`
1. `Square`
1. `Rectangle`
1. `Circle`

The figures should all report the following:

1. Perimeter (_obw√≥d_)
1. Area (_pole_)

Write tests and publish to Github.

## Theory

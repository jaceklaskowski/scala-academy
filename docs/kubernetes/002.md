## Minikube: Start With More Memory & CPUs

Read [Minikube: Start With More Memory & CPUs](https://www.shellhacks.com/minikube-start-with-more-memory-cpus/) to learn how to start minikube with more memory and CPUs.

## Exercises: Spark on minikube

## Exercise: HorizontalPodAutoscaler Walkthrough

[HorizontalPodAutoscaler Walkthrough](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale-walkthrough/)

## Deployments in Kubernetes

Read [Deployments](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/).

## (optional) Exercise: Kafka Streams on minikube

This is a fairly challenging (_hard_?) exercise and hence optional. It should help you understand how to scale applications up and down but more importantly how to deploy a Kafka application that consumes records from a Kafka cluster on minikube (if possible) or outside minikube.

Scaling up and down a Kafka Streams application on minikube.

1. Create a Kafka Streams application
2. Deploy it to Kubernetes (minikube)

The main challenge is to set up a Kafka cluster so it is accessible to the Kafka Streams application.

## New Learning Approach for Thu and Fri

Taking on a new learning approach where 10 people are split into two teams (5 people each):

1. Advanced
2. Regulars

The teams work remotely.

The Advanced team is responsible for developing a game [Tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) in the coming two days (Thu and Fri). They work alone.

Besides, one person from the Advanced team learns [ScalaTest](https://www.scalatest.org/) to be ready for a demo on Monday next week.

The Regulars work on the [S-99: Ninety-Nine Scala Problems](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/) to catch up to the Advanced team.

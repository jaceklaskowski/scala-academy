# Day 4 / May 19 (Thu)

## Live Coding Session

Working together on [Exercise: Dockerized Kafka Cluster](./003.md#exercise-dockerized-kafka-streams-application)

## Scala Exercises

### n Last Elements

Write a function that takes `n` last elements out of a collection of strings.

No use of `Seq`'s built-in methods but `foldLeft` allowed. Just one pass over a collection is allowed.

### Intertwine Two Collections

Write a function that intertwines two collections of possibly different sizes and concatenates them character by character.

```text
val left = Seq(1,2,3,4,5)
val right = Seq("a", "b")

def concat(ns: Seq[Int], ss: Seq[String]): Seq[String] = ???

concat(left, right) shouldBe Seq("1a2b345")
```

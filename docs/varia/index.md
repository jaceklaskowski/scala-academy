# Varia (Weeks 12 and 13)

This is the last Weeks 12 and 13 (just Monday) of our 3-month-long learning journey called Scala Academy.

This is to review all the topics once again, paying particular focus on gaps in our understanding.

It takes the whole Week 12 (May 16-20) and two Mondays (May 23 and 30).

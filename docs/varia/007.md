# Day 7 / May 30 (Mon)

This is the last day of Scala Academy just a day before the [Final Exam](../final-exam.md).

It is a series of individual sessions (_1-on-1s_) where students have got their chance to learn at their own pace and standards.

Others are allowed to join but are not allowed to talk or ask questions.

The idea is that a student has their own time to explore the topics once again to prepare themselves for the exam (with others just listening and learning along).

## JSON

_Heads-up!_

There is one topic we seemed to have missed in the course of Scala Academy, namely **JSON**.

In case, you've got no questions during your sessions, I'm going to use it to check out how well you're prepared to tackle new problems like JSON parsing and JSON serde using Scala, Spark and Kafka.

If you're curious what it takes, let me know during your own session (so it's you not me to lead your session :wink:).

p.s. Just learnt how to use emojis in markdown on Github using [github markdown emoji markup](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908).

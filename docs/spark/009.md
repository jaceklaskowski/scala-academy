# Day 9 / Apr 14 (Thu)

Back to Scala with a bit of Spark SQL.

The following is a list of exercises to help you hone your skills in Scala (with some Spark SQL). You are supposed to do the exercises alone. In the end, push your projects to Github.

There is no ordering. There is no need to do them all. You can pick whatever exercises you like in any order.

Use slack to ask questions. You can DM me directly or use `#scala-academy` channel. Up to your liking.

_Enjoy!_

## Exercises

These exercises are about Spark SQL.

1. [Selecting the most important rows per assigned priority](https://jaceklaskowski.github.io/spark-workshop/exercises/sql/selecting-the-most-important-rows-per-assigned-priority.html)
1. [Exercise: Reverse-engineering Dataset.show Output](https://jaceklaskowski.github.io/spark-workshop/exercises/spark-sql-exercise-Reverse-engineering-Dataset-show-Output.html)
1. [Exercise: Specifying Table and SQL Query on Command Line](https://jaceklaskowski.github.io/spark-workshop/exercises/spark-sql-exercise-Specifying-Table-and-SQL-Query-on-Command-Line.html)

## Scala Project: Node

Write a class `Node` that can have zero, one or more `Node` children. The class should support adding a child `Node`, removing and listing them.

The most challenging part is `display` method that should display a `Node` with all children (that in turn may have `Node` children that are supposed to be displayed, too).

A sample display could look like the following:

```text
AdaptiveSparkPlan
+- Union
   :- HashAggregate_1
   :  +- Exchange
   :     +- HashAggregate
   :        +- Project
   :           +- Range
   +- HashAggregate_2
      +- Exchange
         +- HashAggregate
            +- Project
               +- Range
```

The above shows a `Node` (called `AdaptiveSparkPlan`) with one child (`Union`) that has two children `HashAggregate_1` and `HashAggregate_2` and so on.

Write unit tests.

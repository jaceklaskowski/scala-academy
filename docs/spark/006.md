# Day 6 / Apr 11 (Mon)

## Introduction: Spark Structured Streaming

Next 3 days are about [Spark Structured Streaming]({{ spark.docs }}/structured-streaming-programming-guide.html) with Scala and SQL.

1. We know [Scala](../scala/index.md) and [Spark SQL](./002.md) already
1. SQL is yet to be learnt

## Morning Exercise / Code Review

1. Select one or more [solutions](001.md#repositories) for a code review
    1. Clone the repo
    1. Execute tests (`sbt test`)
    1. Import the project to IntelliJ IDEA
    1. Take notes about interesting parts of the code
    1. Be ready with questions to the author
    1. (advanced) If you find a bug, write a failing test
1. Time: 45 mins

## Self-Study: Reading Official Documentation

1. [Structured Streaming Programming Guide]({{ spark.docs }}/structured-streaming-programming-guide.html)
1. [Scala examples](https://github.com/apache/spark/tree/v{{ spark.version }}/examples/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/examples/sql/streaming)

## Demo: Writing Your First Spark Structured Streaming Application

Based on [Quick Example]({{ spark.docs }}/structured-streaming-programming-guide.html#quick-example).

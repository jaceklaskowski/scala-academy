## Pair Programming

[Pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming)

### Zoo Inheritance

1. Create a command-line application that loads a zoo registry (a file with animal names and their count)
1. Create a trait `Animal` that defines `def talk`, `def walk` and `def numberOfLegs`
1. Create concrete classes for animals, e.g. `Lion`, `Duck`, `Cat`, `Dog`
1. Create a sequence of animals and let them `talk`, `walk`, and displays `numberOfLegs`

```scala
trait Animal {}
case class Lion(...) extends Animal {}
// ...
```

```scala
val animals = Seq[Animal](...)
```

```scala
animals.foreach { a => ??? }
```

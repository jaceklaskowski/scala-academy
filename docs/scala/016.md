# Day 16 / Mar 22 (Tue)

## Warm-Up Exercises

### All Coordinates

Write a function that takes 8 uppercase letters (from A to H) and 8 numbers (from 1 to 8) and returns all the possible 64 coordinates (A1, A2,..., A8, B1,...).

### Corner Half

Change the above function to return one of the two "corner" halves.

### Word Occurences

Write a function that reads a file and prints out word stats: all the words and their occurences.

## Pair Programming

Use [Pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) technique and our `randomPairs` polymorphic method to work together on a solution to the exercise.

### File Stats

Write a function that reads a file and prints out the file statistics based on one of the following command-line options:

1. **--words** - All the words and their occurences

1. **--lines** - All the lines and their length (number of characters, incl. whitespaces), the number of words, and the output of `--words`

### Stacked Boxes

Develop an application that takes variable number of strings (of odd lenght, e.g. 1, 3, 5, ...) and prints them out as stacked boxes.

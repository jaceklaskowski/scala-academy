# Day 16 / Mar 22 (Tue)

## Warm-Up Exercises

### All Coordinates

Write a function that takes 8 uppercase letters (from A to H) and 8 numbers (from 1 to 8) and returns all the possible 64 coordinates (A1, A2,..., A8, B1,...).

---

Review a solution in `solutions/all-coordinates.sc`.

### Corner Half

Change the above function to return one of the two "corner" halves.

---

Review a solution in `solutions/cornerHalf.sc`.

### Word Occurences

Write a function that reads a file and prints out word stats: all the words and their occurences.

---

Review solutions in `solutions/wordOccurences.sc`.

## Type Aliases

Read up on the topic in [Type alias](https://netvl.github.io/scala-guidelines/type-system/type-aliases.html):

> Type aliases should be used instead of subtyping, when this subclassing does not actually extend the original type.

---

```scala
case class Occ(n: Int)

type Occurence = Int
type Word = String
```

With the above type aliases, you can define a return type to be `Seq[(Word, Occurence)]`.

## collection.Map

Learn more in the following resources:

1. [Standard Library](https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/collections-2.13/maps.html)
1. [scala.collection.Map]({{ scala.api }}/scala/collection/Map.html)

## Pair Programming

Use [Pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) technique and our `randomPairs` polymorphic method to work together on a solution to the exercise.

### File Stats

Write a function that reads a file and prints out the file statistics based on one of the following command-line options:

1. **--words** - All the words and their occurences

1. **--lines** - All the lines and their length (number of characters, incl. whitespaces), the number of words, and the words themselves (as a comma-separated sequence or similar)

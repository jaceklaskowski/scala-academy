# Day 20 / Mar 28 (Mon)

## Pair Programming

[Pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming)

### Roman to Arabic Numeral Converter

(Before lunch)

Create a brand new project for a command-line application that converts a [Roman number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals) to the corresponding [Arabic number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_numerals) and vice versa.

1. The application should accept an option to indicate "direction", i.e. from Roman to Arabic or the opposite. 
    1. Advanced version: Let the application determine it

1. The application should take a string of numerals on command line until a user exits

1. Publish the project to GitHub and announce on slack

### Language Teacher

(After lunch)

Create a new project for a command-line application that teaches a language (e.g. English).

The application works with a `dictionary` file that stores translations. The file is loaded at the startup and updated with new translations at shutdown (exit).

The application uses another file for a user score. The file contains words, how often they were asked for and the ratio of successful answers.

The application is meant to ask words to translate from Polish to English and vice versa and score answers (a success = 1 or a failure = 0).

Words with lower score should be asked more often (e.g. twice as often as others).

Publish the project to GitHub and announce on slack.

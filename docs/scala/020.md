## Pair Programming

### Roman to Arabic Numeral Converter

Create a brand new project for a command-line application that converts a [Roman number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals) to the corresponding [Arabic number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_numerals) and vice versa.

1. The application should accept an option to indicate "direction", i.e. from Roman to Arabic or the opposite. 
    1. Advanced version: Let the application determine it

1. The application should take a string of numerals on command line until a user exits

1. Publish the project to GitHub and announce on slack

### Language Teacher

Create a new project for a command-line application that teaches a language (e.g. English).

The application works with a file that stores translations. The file is loaded at the startup and updated with new translations at shutdown (exit).

The application uses another file for a user score. The file contains words, how often they were asked for and the ratio of successful answers.

The application is meant to ask words to translate from Polish to English and vice versa and score answers (a success = 1 or a failure = 0).

Words with lower score should be asked more often (e.g. twice as often as others).

Publish the project to GitHub and announce on slack.

## Hands-on Scala Programming

Ask the group about their "experience" with [Hands-on Scala Programming](https://www.handsonscala.com/table-of-contents.html)

## ScalaTest

Developing tests using [ScalaTest](https://www.scalatest.org/) test framework.

### Zoo Inheritance

1. Create a command-line application that loads a zoo registry (a file with animal names and their count)
1. Create a trait `Animal` that defines `def talk`, `def walk` and `def numberOfLegs`
1. Create concrete classes for animals, e.g. `Lion`, `Duck`, `Cat`, `Dog`
1. Create a sequence of animals and let them `talk`, `walk`, and displays `numberOfLegs`

```scala
trait Animal {}
case class Lion(...) extends Animal {}
// ...
```

```scala
val animals = Seq[Animal](...)
```

```scala
animals.foreach { a => ??? }
```

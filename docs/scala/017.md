# Day 17 / Mar 23 (Wed)

## Warm-Up Exercises

### Consecutive Duplicates of Elements

```scala
def consecutiveDuplicates[T](ts: Seq[T], n: Int): Seq[T]
```

```scala
val ns = Seq(1,2,3,4,5)
val actual = consecutiveDuplicates(ns, 3)
val expected = Seq(1,2,2,3,3,3,4,5,5)
assert(actual == expected)
```

```scala
val ss = Seq("one", "two", "three", "four")
val actual = consecutiveDuplicates(ns, 3)
val expected = Seq(
    "one",
    "two", "two",
    "three", "three", "three",
    "four")
assert(actual == expected)
```

## Pair Programming

### File Stats using scopt

Use [scopt](https://github.com/scopt/scopt) to handle command-line options in the File Stats application we did yesterday:

1. **--words** - All the words and their occurences

1. **--lines** - All the lines and their length (number of characters, incl. whitespaces), the number of words, and the output of `--words`

### Stacked Boxes

Develop an application that takes variable number of strings (of odd lenght, e.g. 1, 3, 5, ...) and prints them out as stacked boxes.

## Exercises

From or based on [Scala for the Impatient](https://horstmann.com/scala/) book:

1. `sum(numbers)` using `foldLeft`

1. Ex 5 page 26

    > Write a procedure `countdown(n: Int)` that prints the numbers from `n` to 0.

1. Ex 2 page 38

    > Write a loop that swaps adjancent elements of an array of integers.

    ```scala
    swap(Array(1,2,3,4,5)) == swap(Array(2,1,4,3,5))
    ```

1. Ex 9 page 47

    > Write a function `lteqgt(values: Array[Int])` that returns a triple containing the counts of values less than `v`, equal to `v`, and greater than `v`.

## Warm-Up Exercises

### Consecutive Duplicates of Elements

```scala
def consecutiveDuplicates[T](ts: Seq[T], n: Int): Seq[T]
```

```scala
val ns = Seq(1,2,3,4,5)
val actual = consecutiveDuplicates(ns, 3)
val expected = Seq(1,2,2,3,3,3,4,5,5)
assert(actual == expected)
```

```scala
val ss = Seq("one", "two", "three", "four")
val actual = consecutiveDuplicates(ns, 3)
val expected = Seq(
    "one",
    "two", "two",
    "three", "three", "three",
    "four")
assert(actual == expected)
```

## Pair Programming

### File Stats using scopt

Use [scopt](https://github.com/scopt/scopt) to handle command-line options in the File Stats application we did yesterday:

1. **--words** - All the words and their occurences

1. **--lines** - All the lines and their length (number of characters, incl. whitespaces), the number of words, and the output of `--words`

### Stacked Boxes

Develop an application that takes variable number of strings (of odd lenght, e.g. 1, 3, 5, ...) and prints them out as stacked boxes.

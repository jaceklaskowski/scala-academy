## Pair Programming

[Pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming)

### Computer

Load a file with instructions and executes them one by one on a board of n x m size.

1. `CREATE [arrow] [x] [y] [id]` - places an `arrow` symbol (^, >, v, <) identified by `id` on the (x, y) field
1. `ROTATE [id] 0, 90, 180, 270, -90, -180, -270` - rotates an arrow to a given direction
1. `MOVE [id] [n]` - moves an arrow forward `n` steps

Display a state of a board every instruction.

Hint: Start with one arrow only. Rotate and move it around.

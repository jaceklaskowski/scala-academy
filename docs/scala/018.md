## Warm-Up Exercises

### Replace Words in Lines

Write a function that replaces words (case-insensitive) in a given collection of `lines` with the strings from `replacements`.

```scala
def replaceWords(
  lines: Seq[String],
  replacements: Map[String, String]): Seq[String] = ???
```

```scala
val actual = replaceWords(
  lines = Seq(
    "Good morning. Nice to see you",
    "Dzien dobry. Jak idzie?"),
  replacements = Map(
    "good" -> "Dobry",
    "see" -> "XXX",
    "jak" -> "How"
  )
)
val expected = Seq(
  "Dobry morning. Nice to XXX you",
  "Dzien dobry. How idzie?")
assert(actual == expected)
```

### MyList

Create a `PriorityList` class to mimic `scala.collection.List` that keeps numbers sorted. Define the following methods:

1. `add(n: Int)`
1. `foreach`
1. `tail`
1. `head` that always returns the higest number

### Zoo Inheritance

1. Create a command-line application that loads a zoo registry (a file with animal names and their count)
1. Create a trait `Animal` that defines `def talk`, `def walk` and `def numberOfLegs`
1. Create concrete classes for animals, e.g. `Lion`, `Duck`, `Cat`, `Dog`
1. Create a sequence of animals and let them `talk`, `walk`, and displays `numberOfLegs`

```scala
trait Animal {}
case class Lion(...) extends Animal {}
// ...
```

```scala
val animals = Seq[Animal](...)
```

```scala
animals.foreach { a => ??? }
```

## Pair Programming

### Computer

Load a file with instructions and executes them one by one on a board of n x m size.

1. `CREATE [x] [y] [arrow]` - places an arrow symbol (^, >, v, <) on the (x, y) field and returns an ID
1. `ROTATE [id] 0, 90, 180, 270, -90, -180, -270` - rotates an arrow to a given direction
1. `MOVE [id] [n]` - moves an arrow forward `n` steps

Display a state of a board every instruction.

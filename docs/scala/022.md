# Day 22 / Mar 30 (Wed)

## Morning Exercise: Sum Element Every N Numbers

Write a function that checks if every two, three, `n` numbers in a sequence are followed by their sum.

```scala
def isSumAfterN(n: Int, ns: Seq[Int]): Boolean = ???
```

Write tests first (using [ScalaTest](https://www.scalatest.org/) test framework).

## Code Review

An interactive session that demo'es the following:

1. How to use GitHub for collaborative development
1. `git` on command line
1. Code refactoring with test support (`sbt test` and IntelliJ IDEA)
1. Contribute to a project using pull requests

## Pair Programming

[Pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming)

### Calculator Again

Create a command-line application that reads a file with a series of math operations (one on each line) and gives the total at the end.

The following operations are supported:

1. `+` (sum)
1. `-` (subtract)
1. `*` (multiply)
1. `/` (divide)
1. `-` (negation) (WARNING: The same symbol with subtraction)

The application should suppport `PRINT` operation that prints out the current total to the standard output (stdout) when it appears in a operation file. There can be zero, one or many `PRINT` commands.

Operation file should support comments (as lines starting with `#` or `//`).

A sample operation file:

```text
# + 4 5
- 8
+ 5
-
PRINT
- 7
PRINT
PRINT
/ 2
```
